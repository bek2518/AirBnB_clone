# AIRBNB CLONE

## Description
This project is the first step towards building a full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first project will be used to build the other following projects which use HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration..

The Command Interpreter will be exactly the same like Shell but limited to a specific use-case.
The Command Interpreter will be able to manage the objects of our project:
* Create a new object like new User or new Place
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database
* Do operation on objects (count, compute stats ...)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

The shell should work like:
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

Undocumented commands:
======================
count

(hbnb) help all

        Prints all representation of all instances
        based or not on the class name
```
